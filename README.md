# A-Star-Pathfinding-Visualizer
A visualization tool for the A* pathfinding algorithm using the Arcade library for visualization.

The A* algorithm was taught in my graduate course "AI for Robotics", so I used that code with minor changes to accompany the Arcade library used for visualization.  The algorithm uses a heuristic to understand where to create the path in the grid, and I calculated the heuristic using euclidean distance to the goal point.
